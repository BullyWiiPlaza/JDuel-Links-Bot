# JDuel Links Bot

This is an ultimate all-in-one modding tool and farming bot for the [**`Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links` Steam version**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/601510/YuGiOh_Duel_Links) trying to fulfill all of your modding and botting needs. This bot's mods can also be used on the [Japanese Yahoo client](https://games.yahoo.co.jp/yugioh/duel_links) but not all features (especially the bot aspect) will work. Due to maintenance issues, support for the Japanese Yahoo client has been more or less cancelled. Sorry for any inconvenience.

*Also feel free to check out our work for [Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1449850/YuGiOh_Master_Duel) here: [JMaster Duel Bot](https://bullywiiplaza.website/jmdb).*

  * [PvP Duel Bot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j-9CgP1i8Q): Let the bot duel for you in PvP
    * ~~[PvP end duel in a tie in the first turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UDbezZA-0M)~~ (patched)

*Optionally, you can also [use our rented Tokyo server for network botting in the most efficient way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-k6AEd67yI) with minimal latency to the game servers. This is especially useful if your Internet is slow or you're forced to use a VPN (e.g. if you're in China). This is best combined with the [master gate key exploit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbchR2Ggs0U) to farm tons of gems for a minimal investment of buying a master gate key with real money.*

## Operating System Support

* Windows 7 64-Bit
* Windows 8/8.1 64-Bit
* Windows 10 64-Bit
* Windows 11 64-Bit

**Note:**
Other operating systems and 32-bit operating systems are not supported, notably Mac OS X, Android, iOS or all other Desktop flavors of Linux.

**Technical reasoning:**
The bot heavily relies on the Windows API and memory hacking is usually a very operating system specific task which cannot be abstracted away easily. The memory addresses, architecture and game executable layout might drastically differ as well due to different compilers etc. for non-Windows platforms which make generic code supporting different operating systems yet another nearly impossible task.

Furthermore, you cannot make a bot or cheats the same way on e.g. Android due to security restrictions. Even simple APK modding got harder to do on recent Android versions. Either way, you probably need a rooted phone to do anything advanced like this bot. Most people don't have a rooted phone (me included).

In conclusion, get or use a Windows PC to enjoy the full benefits of the bot. Every family should have one. Even if it's older, it should work fine for the most part.

## Runtime Requirements

For this bot you need to install `Java 16 64-bit` (or above). Consider downloading the recommended Java version through the provided launcher (`JDuel Links Bot.exe`) from the download.

Check the `README.txt` in the download archive for more information on how to set this tool up.

## Bugs and Feature Requests

I appreciate any kind of feedback so I can improve the bot by fixing issues and adding more useful features since **this bot is actively being developed until further notice**.
